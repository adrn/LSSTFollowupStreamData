Right now, I'm just doing a few simple experiments for Kathryn to see if 1% distances to RR Lyrae are really better than 5% for measuring the mass and shape of a potential. I tested the procedure in the notebook "Orbit fit - proof of concept", but I'm going to split this into a notebook + script so I can run the different tests simultaneously on a cluster. I will generate fake catalogs in the notebook "Orbit fit - make data" and the script will be "scripts/kvj_orbitfit.py".
